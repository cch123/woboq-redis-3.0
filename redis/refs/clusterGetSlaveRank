<doc f='redis/src/cluster.c' l='2550'>/* This function returns the &quot;rank&quot; of this instance, a slave, in the context
 * of its master-slaves ring. The rank of the slave is given by the number of
 * other slaves for the same master that have a better replication offset
 * compared to the local one (better means, greater, so they claim more data).
 *
 * A slave with rank 0 is the one with the greatest (most up to date)
 * replication offset, and so forth. Note that because how the rank is computed
 * multiple slaves may have the same rank, in case they have the same offset.
 *
 * The slave rank is used to add a delay to start an election in order to
 * get voted and replace a failing master. Slaves with better replication
 * offsets are more likely to win. */</doc>
