 * sentinels in the specified &apos;master&apos;, having either:
 *
 * 1) The same ip/port as specified.
 * 2) The same runid.
 *
 * &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; don&apos;t need to verify at the same time, just one is enough.
 * If &quot;runid&quot; is NULL it is not checked.
 * Similarly if &quot;ip&quot; is NULL it is not checked.
 *
 * This function is useful because every time we add a new Sentinel into
 * a master&apos;s Sentinels dictionary, we want to be very sure about not
 * having duplicated instances for any reason. This is important because
 * other sentinels are needed to reach ODOWN quorum, and later to get
 * voted for a given configuration epoch in order to perform the failover.
 *
 * The function returns the number of Sentinels removed. */</doc>
