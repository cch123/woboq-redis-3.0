<doc f='redis/src/cluster.c' l='3490'>/* This function is called after the node startup in order to verify that data
 * loaded from disk is in agreement with the cluster configuration:
 *
 * 1) If we find keys about hash slots we have no responsibility for, the
 *    following happens:
 *    A) If no other node is in charge according to the current cluster
 *       configuration, we add these slots to our node.
 *    B) If according to our config other nodes are already in charge for
 *       this lots, we set the slots as IMPORTING from our point of view
 *       in order to justify we have those slots, and in order to make
 *       redis-trib aware of the issue, so that it can try to fix it.
 * 2) If we find data in a DB different than DB0 we return REDIS_ERR to
 *    signal the caller it should quit the server with an error message
 *    or take other actions.
 *
 * The function always returns REDIS_OK even if it will try to correct
 * the error described in &quot;1&quot;. However if data is found in DB different
 * from DB0, REDIS_ERR is returned.
 *
 * The function also uses the logging facility in order to warn the user
 * about desynchronizations between the data we have in memory and the
 * cluster configuration. */</doc>
