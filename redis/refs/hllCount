 * If the sparse representation of the HLL object is not valid, the integer
 * pointed by &apos;invalid&apos; is set to non-zero, otherwise it is left untouched.
 *
 * hllCount() supports a special internal-only encoding of HLL_RAW, that
 * is, hdr-&gt;registers will point to an uint8_t array of HLL_REGISTERS element.
 * This is useful in order to speedup PFCOUNT when called against multiple
 * keys (no need to work with 6-bit integers encoding). */</doc>
