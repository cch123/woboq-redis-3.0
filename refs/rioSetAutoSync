 * By default this is set to zero that means no automatic file sync is
 * performed.
 *
 * This feature is useful in a few contexts since when we rely on OS write
 * buffers sometimes the OS buffers way too much, resulting in too many
 * disk I/O concentrated in very little time. When we fsync in an explicit
 * way instead the I/O pressure is more distributed across time. */</doc>
