 * and so forth.
 *
 * It calls the event loop in order to process a few events. Specifically we
 * try to call the event loop for times as long as we receive acknowledge that
 * some event was processed, in order to go forward with the accept, read,

 * The function returns the total number of events processed. */</doc>
