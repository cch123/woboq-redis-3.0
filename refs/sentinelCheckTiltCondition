 *
 * The TILT mode is entered if we detect that between two invocations of the
 * timer interrupt, a negative amount of time, or too much time has passed.
 * Note that we expect that more or less just 100 milliseconds will pass
 * if everything is fine. However we&apos;ll see a negative number or a
 * difference bigger than SENTINEL_TILT_TRIGGER milliseconds if one of the
 * following conditions happen:
 *
 * 1) The Sentiel process for some time is blocked, for every kind of
 * random reason: the load is huge, the computer was frozen for some time
 * in I/O or alike, the process was stopped by a signal. Everything.
 * 2) The system clock was altered significantly.
 *
 * Under both this conditions we&apos;ll see everything as timed out and failing
 * without good reasons. Instead we enter the TILT mode and wait
 * for SENTINEL_TILT_PERIOD to elapse before starting to act again.
 *
 * During TILT time we still collect information, we just do not act. */</doc>
