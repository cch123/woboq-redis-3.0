 *  RPOPLPUSH srclist dstlist:
 *    IF LLEN(srclist) &gt; 0
 *      element = RPOP srclist
 *      LPUSH dstlist element
 *      RETURN element
 *    ELSE
 *      RETURN nil
 *    END
 *  END
 *
 * The idea is to be able to get an element from a list in a reliable way
 * since the element is not just returned but pushed against another list
 * as well. This command was originally proposed by Ezra Zygmuntowicz.
