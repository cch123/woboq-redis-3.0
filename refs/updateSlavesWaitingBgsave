<doc f='redis/src/replication.c' l='732'>/* This function is called at the end of every background saving,
 * or when the replication RDB transfer strategy is modified from
 * disk to socket or the other way around.
 *
 * The goal of this function is to handle slaves waiting for a successful
 * background saving in order to perform non-blocking synchronization, and
 * to schedule a new BGSAVE if there are slaves that attached while a
 * BGSAVE was in progress, but it was not a good one for replication (no
 * other slave was accumulating differences).
 *
 * The argument bgsaveerr is REDIS_OK if the background saving succeeded
 * otherwise REDIS_ERR is passed to the function.
 * The &apos;type&apos; argument is the type of the child that terminated
 * (if it had a disk or socket target). */</doc>
