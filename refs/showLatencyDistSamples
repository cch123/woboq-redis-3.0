 * of the collected samples targeting an xterm 256 terminal.
 *
 * Takes an array of distsamples structures, ordered from smaller to bigger
 * &apos;max&apos; value. Last sample max must be 0, to mean that it olds all the
 * samples greater than the previous one, and is also the stop sentinel.
 *
 * &quot;tot&apos; is the total number of samples in the different buckets, so it
 * is the SUM(samples[i].conut) for i to 0 up to the max sample.
 *
 * As a side effect the function sets all the buckets count to 0. */</doc>
