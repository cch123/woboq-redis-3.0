 * It happens if the following conditions are met:
 *
 * 1) We received enough failure reports from other master nodes via gossip.
 *    Enough means that the majority of the masters signaled the node is
 *    down recently.
 * 2) We believe this node is in PFAIL state.
 *
 * If a failure is detected we also inform the whole cluster about this
 * event trying to force every other node to set the FAIL flag for the node.
 *
 * Note that the form of agreement used here is weak, as we collect the majority
 * of masters state during some time, and even if we force agreement by
 * propagating the FAIL message, because of partitions we may not reach every
 * node. However:
 *
 * 1) Either we reach the majority and eventually the FAIL state will propagate
 *    to all the cluster.
 * 2) Or there is no majority so no slave promotion will be authorized and the
 *    FAIL flag will be cleared after some time.
