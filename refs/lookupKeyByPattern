 * 1) The first occurrence of &apos;*&apos; in &apos;pattern&apos; is substituted with &apos;subst&apos;.

 * 2) If &apos;pattern&apos; matches the &quot;-&gt;&quot; string, everything on the left of

 *
 * 3) If &apos;pattern&apos; equals &quot;#&quot;, the function simply returns &apos;subst&apos; itself so
