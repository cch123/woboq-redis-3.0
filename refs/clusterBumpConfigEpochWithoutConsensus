<doc f='redis/src/cluster.c' l='937'>/* If this node epoch is zero or is not already the greatest across the
 * cluster (from the POV of the local configuration), this function will:
 *
 * 1) Generate a new config epoch increment the current epoch.
 * 2) Assign the new epoch to this node, WITHOUT any consensus.
 * 3) Persist the configuration on disk before sending packets with the
 *    new configuration.
 *
 * If the new config epoch is generated and assigend, REDIS_OK is returned,
 * otherwise REDIS_ERR is returned (since the node has already the greatest
 * configuration around) and no operation is performed.
 *
 * Important note: this function violates the principle that config epochs
 * should be generated with consensus and should be unique across the cluster.
 * However Redis Cluster uses this auto-generated new config epochs in two
 * cases:
 *
 * 1) When slots are closed after importing. Otherwise resharding would be
 *    too exansive.
 * 2) When CLUSTER FAILOVER is called with options that force a slave to
 *    failover its master even if there is not master majority able to
 *    create a new configuration epoch.
 *
 * Redis Cluster does not explode using this function, even in the case of
 * a collision between this node and another node, generating the same
 * configuration epoch unilaterally, because the config epoch conflict
 * resolution algorithm will eventually move colliding nodes to different
 * config epochs. However usign this function may violate the &quot;last failover
 * wins&quot; rule, so should only be used with care. */</doc>
