 * PING, PONG or UPDATE packet. What we receive is a node, a configEpoch of the
 * node, and the set of slots claimed under this configEpoch.
 *
 * What we do is to rebind the slots with newer configuration compared to our
 * local configuration, and if needed, we turn ourself into a replica of the
 * node (see the function comments for more info).
 *
 * The &apos;sender&apos; is the node for which we received a configuration update.
 * Sometimes it is not actually the &quot;Sender&quot; of the information, like in the case
 * we receive the info via an UPDATE packet. */</doc>
