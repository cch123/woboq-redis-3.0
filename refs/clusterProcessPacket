 * function should just handle the higher level stuff of processing the
 * packet, modifying the cluster state if needed.
 *
 * The function returns 1 if the link is still valid after the packet
 * was processed, otherwise 0 if the link was freed since the packet
 * processing lead to some inconsistency error (for instance a PONG
 * received from the wrong sender ID). */</doc>
