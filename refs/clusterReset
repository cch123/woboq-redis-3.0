 *
 * 1) All other nodes are forget.
 * 2) All the assigned / open slots are released.
 * 3) If the node is a slave, it turns into a master.
 * 5) Only for hard reset: a new Node ID is generated.
 * 6) Only for hard reset: currentEpoch and configEpoch are set to 0.
 * 7) The new configuration is saved and the cluster state updated.
 * 8) If the node was a slave, the whole data set is flushed away. */</doc>
